        # *   monitored_requests: The system returns the time series data of requests that match Monitor protection rules.

The returned results are grouped by protection module and can be used to generate time series charts. A request can match multiple protection modules. Therefore, the total number of matched requests is inconsistent with the total number of requests.

The returned results are grouped by protection module and can be used to generate time series charts. A request can be blocked by only one protection module. Therefore, the total number of blocked requests is consistent with the total number of requests.
